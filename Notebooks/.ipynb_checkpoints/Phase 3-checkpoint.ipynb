    "## **3.11 Bayesian Optimization of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Motivation for Bayesian Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) exhibit strong performance in turbulence modeling due to their ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Capture nonlinear feature interactions\n",
    "#### * Handle mixed-scale physical inputs\n",
    "#### * Provide stable predictions in near-wall regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### However, GBDT performance is **highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection**. Manual tuning or grid search is inefficient due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * High-dimensional hyperparameter space\n",
    "#### * Strong coupling between parameters\n",
    "#### * Expensive training costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, **Bayesian Optimization** is employed to systematically and efficiently identify optimal hyperparameters using validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Optuna?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optuna is a modern Bayesian optimization framework that:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Builds a probabilistic surrogate model of the objective function\n",
    "#### * Selects new hyperparameter configurations based on past evaluations\n",
    "#### * Efficiently balances exploration and exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compared to grid or random search, Optuna converges to high-performing configurations with **significantly fewer trials**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optimization Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "### For each training case and each pressure–strain component $( \\Phi_{ij} )$, Bayesian optimization is performed to minimize the **validation mean squared error (MSE)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$[\\mathcal{L}*{\\text{val}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum*{n=1}^{N}\\left(\\Phi_{ij}^{(n)} - \\hat{\\Phi}_{ij}^{(n)}\\right)^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### where:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * $( \\Phi_{ij} )$ are DNS targets\n",
    "#### * $( \\hat{\\Phi}_{ij} )$ are GBDT predictions\n",
    "#### * Validation data is **never used for training**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Hyperparameters Tuned**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The following GBDT hyperparameters are optimized:\n",

    "| `colsample_bytree` | Feature-level regularization              |\n",

    "### **Bayesian Optimization Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "### For each **case $( c \\in {1,2,3,4} )$** and **component $( \\Phi_{ij} )$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Fix training and validation datasets**\n",
    "#### 2. **Define Optuna objective function**\n",
    "#### 3. **Train a temporary GBDT model** using trial parameters\n",
    "#### 4. **Evaluate validation MSE**\n",
    "#### 5. **Update Optuna’s surrogate model**\n",
    "#### 6. **Repeat for multiple trials**\n",

    "## Phase 3 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this phase, physics-informed machine learning models were trained to predict the pressure–strain correlation component $(\\phi_{12})$ for turbulent channel flow using DNS data. The learning problem was formulated as a scalar regression task, with input features derived from turbulence modeling theory, including Reynolds stress anisotropy, turbulence kinetic energy, dissipation rate, and the mean velocity gradient. A Reynolds-number-aware data organization was strictly enforced to avoid information leakage and to preserve physical consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three regression models, namely a multilayer perceptron, a random forest, and a gradient boosted decision tree, were trained and validated across four independent case configurations. For each case, training and validation were performed using data from three Reynolds numbers, while the remaining Reynolds number was completely excluded from this phase. Bayesian optimization using Optuna was applied to tune the hyperparameters of the gradient boosted decision tree model based solely on validation performance. All trained models and preprocessing pipelines were serialized for reproducibility and subsequent evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The outcomes of Phase 3 demonstrate that machine learning models can successfully learn the nonlinear relationship between physically meaningful input features and the pressure–strain component $(\\phi_{12})$ without prior exposure to unseen Reynolds numbers. This phase establishes a stable and physically consistent training framework, preparing the models for rigorous generalization assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transition to Phase 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Phase 3 focused on training and validation within known Reynolds-number regimes, the ultimate objective of this study is to evaluate whether the learned models can generalize to unseen flow conditions. Phase 4 addresses this objective by testing the trained models on Reynolds-number datasets that were entirely excluded during training and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Phase 4, each trained model will be evaluated on the held-out Reynolds number corresponding to its case configuration. Model performance will be assessed using quantitative metrics such as the coefficient of determination $((R^2))$, along with comparisons between predicted and DNS profiles of $(\\phi_{12})$ across the wall-normal direction. This phase will provide direct insight into the Reynolds-number generalization capability of physics-informed machine learning models for pressure-strain closure.\n",
